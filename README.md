VirtualEnv Set Up
The venv has been .gitignore'd, so all of the dependencies have been frozen into requirements.txt. To rebuild a mirrored Virtualenv, at the root of your project directory run the following:

$ python3 -m venv env
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
If you download any additional packages through pip for the project, please include them in the requirements.txt by running:

$ pip freeze > "requirements.txt"
